# PressFlow - Laundry & Pressing Management System

PressFlow is a full-stack MERN application designed as a comprehensive Software as a Service (SaaS) platform for laundry and pressing businesses. It provides tools for business owners (Tenants) to manage their operations, customers, and orders, while also featuring a public-facing directory for end-users to discover local laundry services.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn)
-   MongoDB Atlas account
-   Cloudinary account

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ndip23/pressing-management-system.git
    cd pressing-management-system
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (`server` directory):**
    -   Navigate to the server directory: `cd server`
    -   Install dependencies: `npm install`
    -   Create a `.env` file and add the following required variables:
        ```env
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
        CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
        ```
    -   Start the backend server: `npm run dev`

3.  **Frontend Setup (`client` directory):**
    -   In a new terminal, navigate to the client directory: `cd client`
    -   Install dependencies: `npm install`
    -   Create a `.env` file and add the backend API URL:
        ```env
        REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000 
        # Port must match your backend server port
        ```
    -   Start the frontend development server: `npm start`

The application should now be running, with the frontend on `http://localhost:3000` and the backend on `http://localhost:5000`.
